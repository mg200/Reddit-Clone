Threadit : A Reddit Clone
Welcome to Threadit, a fully functional Reddit clone developed as part of a university course on Software Engineering. This repository contains the source code and documentation for both the website and Android app versions of Threadit, a platform where users can create, share, and discuss content in a community-driven environment.

# Project Overview
Threadit was developed by a team of 18 students, organized into specialized teams to ensure a comprehensive and high-quality product. The project included both a responsive website and a feature-rich Android application. The teams and their primary responsibilities were as follows:

Backend (BE) Team: Focused on developing the server-side logic, database management, and API creation to support the application's functionality.
Frontend (FE) Team: Responsible for designing and implementing the user interface and user experience for the web application.
Cross-Platform (Mobile) Team: Developed the Android application, ensuring it provided a seamless experience across different devices.
Testing Team: Conducted rigorous testing of both the web and mobile applications to identify and resolve bugs, ensuring overall reliability and performance.
DevOps Team: Handled deployment, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and maintaining the infrastructure required for the project.

# My Role: Tester    
  As a tester for Threaddit, I was responsible for both the testing of the Android application as well as the stress and load testing for the desktop app. My tasks included the following:
  1. Developing Test Scripts for the Android Threddit App using Flutter Appium driver.
  2. Conducting stress and load testing for the desktop application using JMeter.
  3. Identifying and documenting bugs and performance issues.
  4. Collaborating with the development team to resolve identified issues.
  5. Ensuring the application meets performance and reliability standards before release.
